Building the documentation
==========================

In order to build the documentation project of Accord.NET Extensions,
a few requisite programs should be previously installed:


 - Sandcastle Help File Builder (SHFB)
   http://shfb.codeplex.com/


Note: The guided SHFB installer should install all 
other dependencies (such as Sandcastle) automatically.

Downloading and opening .chm files
================================== 

The content of a .chm file (Windows local help file) may not be displayed properly after being downloaded.
The file must be unblocked after being downloaded.
